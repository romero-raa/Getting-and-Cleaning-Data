Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
=========================================

My Github repo contains work for Coursera data science course funded by the Department of Science and Technology as part of its data scicne specialization program

About the Code Book
-------------------
The CodeBook file is a modified codebook file of the same ones in the data set given.

Raw data
------------------

Raw data was provided from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

Features (561) are unlabeled and found in x_test file.
Activity labels are found in y_test file.
The training sets have their own corresponding files.

Script and tidy data set output
--------------------------------

As required, a script named run_analysis to collect, merge, and clean all the data sets are done. Cleaning the data included adding labels and discarding all non-mean and standard deviation data. The final output is in this repo named second_tidy_set.txt also uploaded in this repository.
